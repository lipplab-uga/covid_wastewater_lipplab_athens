Sewage samples are collected weekly from water reclamation facilities that serve Athens Clarke County (WRF A and WRF B). Samples are tested to detect and measure SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2, the virus that causes COVID&#8209;19. 

We measure the virus by detecting two genes specific to SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2, the N1 and N2 nucleocapsid genes, using RT-qPCR. The N1 and N2 gene targets are measured and reported as a concentration, in number of gene copies per liter of wastewater. The theoretical Limit of Detection (LOD) is noted.

We predict that changes in the concentration of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater will reflect the community trends of circulating COVID&#8209;19 infections. The daily number of newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases in Athens-Clarke County (grey) appear alongside the 10-day moving average of new cases (yellow). Changes in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater may precede changes in reported cases because of lags in clinical testing.

#### Weekly Data Update {.tabset}

##### Prior to August 16, 2020
Data collection began in June of 2020 where the concentration of ARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 was below the limit of detection at the start of experimentation. At the end of June SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentration had rose to over 10 million copies per liter and held moderately steady through mid-July. Following July 21, 2020 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 copies began to decline through early August. Since August 4, 2020 ARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentration has steadily increased for both the N1 and N2 gene targets.  

These results were consistent with the increases and declines observed in the daily cases reported for Athens-Clarke County, GA. 

##### August 16-22
On August 18, 2020, the concentration of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 increased to over 100,000 copies per liter for both gene targets. This uptick is not reflected in the daily reported cases for Athens-Clarke county and may precede an increase in the number of reported COVID&#8209;19.  

Furthermore, this week marks the return of approximately 30,000 undergraduate students to the UGA main campus for the start of the fall semester.

#### Research Overview {.tabset}

##### Purpose

Wastewater surveillance is an emerging tool for monitoring disease outbreaks. Coupled with clinical surveillance, wastewater surveillance can be used to estimate the level of viruses circulating in local population. 

To better understand the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID&#8209;19) on a local level, we are monitoring wastewater samples from water reclamation facilities in Athens, GA. Wastewater samples are collected weekly and tested to detect the disease-causing virus, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2. 

Each sample is a composite of the wastewater received by the water reclamation facility in a single day. By examining these samples, we are capturing a snapshot into the health of the entire community that contributes to the sewershed. This wastewater-based research provides a new approach to epidemiology; sewage surveillance may be used to predict the total burden of disease at a community-scale, without extensive clinical sampling.

We are sharing here some of the preliminary results of our wastewater monitoring program. Our objective is to critically examine the use of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 wastewater-based epidemiology for the detection and surveillance of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in our local community. 

We are developing and evaluating our methods in real-time. We will share with you our weekly results and newest developments. This data is intended to complement clinical-based COVID&#8209;19 surveillance data, that will together, inform public health decisions.

##### Methods

Since May 2020, sewage samples have been collected weekly from the water reclamation facilities (WRFs) that serve Athens-Clarke County. Samples are collected from a 24-hour composite of the influent wastewater received by each WRF. 

Samples are processed by the Lipp Laboratory at the University of Georgia to detect and measure the abundance of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus in wastewater. 

Viral RNA, the genetic material of the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus, is extracted from each sample using the <a href="https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/diagnostics-and-clinical-research/sample-processing/qiaamp-viral-rna-mini-kit/#orderinginformation" target="_blank">QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit.</a>

The viral RNA is then measured using Real-Time RT-PCR Assays, following the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/guidance/f-lab/assays.html" target="_blank">CDC's test protocol </a> for the N1 and N2 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 nucleocapsid genes. 

The N1 and N2 gene targets are measured and reported as a concentration, by the number of gene copies measured per liter of wastewater.
