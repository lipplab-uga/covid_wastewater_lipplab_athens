This dashboard provides weekly updates of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 (the virus that causes COVID&#8209;19) levels in wastewater for Athens-Clarke County (ACC). Wastewater sampling can detect viruses that may be shed in feces from infected people within an entire community, including those that are presymptomatic and asymptomatic. This offers a method of estimating trends in community-scale circulation of COVID&#8209;19 that does not rely on clinical or surveillance testing of individuals. Although we cannot currently use wastewater-based testing to estimate a specific number of people infected in a community, it can be used to understand trends and to anticipate potential increases in cases.

### Data Trends

The trendline below reflects the estimated total viral load of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in the combined sewershed of Athens-Clarke County (the service area for all three plants) (top chart) over time. The daily number of newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases in Athens-Clarke County (purple bars) appear alongside the 7-day moving average of new cases (yellow line) (bottom chart). We are using these data to estimate how changes in the concentration of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater may reflect the community trends of circulating COVID&#8209;19 infections.  

```{r out.height = "500%", out.width = "100%", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
load(file = "./plotly_fig.rda")

```


```{r fig.hold='hold', out.height = "75%", out.width = "75%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./good_legend.png")
```

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

**Note about chart and methods**.    
The viral load estimated is based on the average concentration of the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 gene copies per liter of wastewater (as determined by the N1 and N2 viral nucleocapsid genes) x the total flow of wastewater over the sampling day. Both genes target the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 genome but have slight differences in how they perform in our tests; therefore, we are averaging them to simplify the interpretation of the viral load. The trend lines were calculated using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS, span = 0.6). The error associated with these estimates (the 95% confidence interval) is displayed as the shaded area. Vertical dashed lines indicate significant events that may affect local public health: June 24, 2020 Georgia continues broad reopening, including bars and restaurants; July 9, 2020 Athens-Clarke County implements mask mandate; August 20, 2020 classes begin at the University of Georgia.

</div>


##### Jan 25 & 27
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The average viral load for the week decreased from the previous week but was still higher than 70% of all samples collected to date. Note that estimates for viral load may be underestimated, due to a significant amount of rainfall during this collection period (1/27). The 7-day average of newly reported cases ended the week (1/29) at 82. Viral load and transmission remain high in Athens-Clarke County.**      

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 25</span>    
The total viral load for Sunday 1/24 through Monday 1/25 decreased compared to the previous week's observations. SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 was detected from all wastewater samples (positivity rate of 100%).   

The 7-day moving average for reported cases was 74 for 1/25/2021.   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 27</span>    
Viral load for the period between Tuesday 1/26 and Wednesday 1/27 was comparable to the viral load estimated from Monday’s collection. It is important to note that Wednesday’s sampling period coincided with a major rain event in the Athens area. Infiltration of stormwater into the sewer system may dilute viral concentrations of wastewater. Sample positivity remains high (100%) and concentrations reached over 1 million copies per liter.   

The 7-day moving average for reported cases was 78 for 1/27/2021.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Jan 19 & 20
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Averaged for the week, total viral load continues to be high (exceeding the load in 90% of samples analyzed to date). Much like the pattern noted last week, the two samples varied substantially with the 1/19 sample reaching extremely high levels and declining the following day. This week the variability between the two days appears to be driven primarily by large changes at particular plants (especially WRF A). Overall, the average total load this week is similar to last week, changing by only 5%. Case reports in Athens-Clarke County declined this week, which follows the declines in sewage levels noted in our 1/4 report. Wastewater observations from the last two weeks suggest that shedding of the virus has increased and may not yet be apparent in case reports.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 19</span>  
Over the 24 h period of collection (6:30 am Monday 1/18 – 6:30 am 1/19), the total viral load at all three plants combined reached the second highest level in our data set (falling only slightly behind the load for 1/11, one week ago). The load increased to the highest level recorded at WRF A (including north Athens, downtown, and UGA), where average concentration exceeded 10 million copies per liter. Little change was observed at WRF B and WRF C compared to levels on 1/13.   

The 7-day running average of reported cases in Athens Clarke County declined to 81 on 1/19.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 20</span>   
Total viral load for the sample collected between 1/19 and 1/20 declined compared to the prior day sample. This is similar to the pattern noted last week as well; however, the decline was not consistent across all three plants. Viral load at WRF C (including East Athens) increased approximately 4-fold reaching a similar level noted the prior week (on 1/11). Levels at the other two plants declined or were stable.  

The 7-day running average of reported cases in Athens Clarke County further declined to 73 by 1/20.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Jan 11 & 13

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The average viral load for the week was among the highest in our sample collection (exceeding the viral load for >94% of samples to date). This was driven by very high counts in Monday’s (1/11) sample. The 7-day average of newly reported cases ended the week (1/15) at 105. Viral load and transmission remain high in Athens-Clarke County.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 11</span>   
Total viral load for Sunday 1/10 through Monday 1/11 increased by 5-fold compared to levels measured the week prior, reaching the highest recorded total viral load through the course of this study. Concentrations increased at all three plants, exceeding 4 million copies per liter. The rate of increase and total load are similar to the trends noted in early to mid-August around the start of the UGA fall semester. These results may reflect an acceleration of new infections,  the increase in population (and possible carriers) with the arrival of students for the start of the UGA spring term, or both.   

The reported 7-day moving average of clinical cases in Athens-Clarke County increased to 107 on 1/11.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 13</span>     
 Viral load for the period between Tuesday 1/12 and Wednesday 1/13 declined from the all-time high noted in Monday’s sample. The decline in load was noted in all treatment plants but sample positivity remains high (100%) and concentrations reached over 3 million copies per liter.   
 
The 7-day moving average for reported cases was 108 for 1/13/2021.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Jan 4

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Note from the team:</span>   
We apologize for the delay in data updates over the last couple of weeks. Critical supplies for our analyses were back ordered and then delayed in shipping. We are now back up and running and working to process our backlog. We will aim to get back to timely updates by next week. One benefit of this short break was that we were able to take some much-needed time to look back critically at our last 30 weeks of work, which has been difficult to do while also in the crunch to get samples processed and analyzed. We reanalyzed the full data set and conducted an intense QA/QC. You will see some slight changes in the charts on the dashboard that reflect this new analysis. We thank you for sticking with us through what has become a much longer effort than any of us imagined.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load decreased slightly for the second week in row, while case reports continue to climb. Levels in wastewater are a real time estimate of viral shedding, and therefore may be out of sync with the timing of case reports, which often lag because of bias toward symptomatic infections and the time between testing and reporting. This current trend could suggest stabilizing case levels, which may not yet be apparent in the clinical reports.  However, our total positivity rate for samples remains at 100%, which indicates that viral shedding (and likely transmission) remain high.**  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 4</span>   
Total viral load for Sunday 1/3 through Monday 1/4 decreased slightly compared to levels measured the week prior, although detection rate remains high (all samples from all plants for both the N1 and N2 gene have been positive since 12/14/2020).  

Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County increased from a 7-day running average of 46 on 12/28/2020 to 84 on 1/4/2021. Although total viral load is currently steady or declining, the current rise in reported cases that began on 12/28 was preceded by 3 weeks of increasing viral load in wastewater (which peaked on 12/21/2020).    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Dec 28 & 30

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 28</span>   
Total viral load for Sunday 12/27 through Monday 12/28 declined by ~10-fold. This decline was observed across all three treatment plants and ends the 3-week trend of rising viral load at WRF C.  

The 7-day running average of reported cases was 54 as of 12/30, which has held steady for the past 10 days (declining from 61 on 12/21).  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 30</span>     
_Data coming soon._  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Dec 21 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 21</span>     
Total viral load was comparable to observations from the previous week. Viral load continues to increase at WRF C, continuing a 2+ week trend. These data suggest that there is consistent viral shedding, but stable transmission within the community.   

As of 12/21 there was an average of 61 new daily cases (7-day running average).  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Dec 14 & 16
 
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The total viral load detected from wastewater for the week of 12/14/2020 continued to increase compared to previous observations; 12/16/2020 marks the highest level observed since August.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 14</span>  
Total viral load for Sunday 12/13 through Monday 12/14 was consistent with those observed last week, suggesting consistent but stable transmission within the community.  

As of 12/14 there was an average of 58 new daily cases (7-day running average). Athens-Clarke county has reported an average of 54 - 58 new cases per day since 12/5.   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 16</span>     
Total viral load for Tuesday 12/15 through Wednesday 12/16 increased to the highest observed level since early August. Total load increased at all three plants, and was especially notable at WRF C, which reached its highest load and concentration to date. This suggests a continued rise in reported cases is likely in the coming days.  

The 7-day running average of reported cases as of 12/16 was 62.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Dec 7 & 9

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total viral loads for the week of 12/07/2020 have increased compared to the prior week; coupled with clinical data, increased viral levels indicate active transmission in the community.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 7</span>   
The total viral load has increased compared to estimates from the previous week. This increase corresponds with the overall increasing trend in viral load over the past several weeks. Coupled with an increase in newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases (seven day running average of 56), these data suggest an increase in viral transmission within the community.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 9</span>   
Total viral load for Tuesday 12/8 through Wednesday 12/9 remains consistent with the increasing trend observed on 12/7. Coupled with an increase in newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases, increasing levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater suggest an increase in viral transmission within the community.    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Nov 30 & Dec 2

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total viral loads for the week of 11/30/2020 declined compared to the prior week; however, levels continue to indicate active transmission in the community.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Site update announcement</span>   
Starting this week (Nov 30 & Dec 2 sampling) we will be reporting our SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 wastewater viral load data as a single metric to improve comprehension. Viral load data will be reported as the average of the N1 and N2 gene targets detected using our assay. Concentration values for both targets will still be reported independently in the "All Data" tab. We feel that this is an easier to understand presentation of the data and is supported after considering 30 weeks of data collection.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 30</span>    
Total viral load for Sunday 11/29 through Monday 11/30 was similar to that noted last week. Of note, this sample collection period included periods of heavy rain on Sunday, which resulted in infiltration of rainwater into sewer lines. This leads to higher than normal volumes entering the treatment plants and diluting of the sewage. Not surprisingly, we noted a decline in the concentration (number of viral copies per liter) because of this dilution (see ‘All Data’), but our estimation of total viral load (total viral copies present) accounts for this effect by correcting for the higher volume. Therefore, total viral load remains high despite the lower concentration.  

As of Monday 11/30, the 7-day average of new cases in Athens Clarke County remained at 30. However, on Wednesday 12/2 the county reported 78 new cases, which is the largest single day report since 9/16 (80 cases).    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 2</span>   
Concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viruses were similar between the 12/2 sample and that collected on 11/30. However, overall viral load declined slightly across the area, with the exception of WRF C, where viral load has been steady to increasing.  

As of 12/03/2020, the 7-day running average of new cases in Athens Clarke County reached 39, which is higher than we have observed since September. As we have noted before, viral levels in wastewater general precede case reports in the community. The uptick in cases this week follows elevated viral loads in sewage that we noted last week.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Nov 23 & 25

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 23</span>   
The levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 have increased approximately 10-fold from the previous sampling period (November 18, 2020). It is too to soon to predict if the increase in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels indicates in increase in transmission. If there is increased transmission, we would expect to see this same trend in our next sampling period (November 25, 2020).  

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases has remained stable for the last 2 weeks (ranging between 27 and 32 new cases per day).  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 25</span>   
The increasing trend observed on 11/23 continued through 11/25 suggesting an increase in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 transmission compared to the prior weeks of sampling. This increase was not observed in the reported clinical cases which have remained steady at approximately 29 cases per day for the past two weeks.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Nov 16 & 18

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 16</span>  
For the Monday sample this week (collected between 6:30 am Sunday 11/15 and 6:30 am Monday 11/16). We observed increased concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 at all plants based on the N1 gene; concentrations (copies per L) increased by >80% since the November 11 sample. However, the N2 gene target was below the limit of detection for all plants. We observed a similar divergence on 11/04 and we are continuing to evaluate the performance of both assays. On balance, the data suggest a slight but consistent increasing trend.  

The 7-day running average of daily reported cases in Athens-Clarke County is 31 as of 11/17, similar to that reported last week, after several weeks of reported cases in the low 20s.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 18</span>  
There was little change in the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations and total load for the sample collected on 11/18. Levels were comparable to those measured on 11/16 and in the previous week. Good agreement was observed in the estimation of both the N1 and N2 gene targets.  

Daily reported cases remain at a seven-day average of 32.  

##### Nov 9 & 11

This week, 24-hour composite samples were collected on Monday 11/9 and Wednesday 11/11. Total daily load estimates for the week show stable to increasing levels. WRF A loads increased modestly on 11/9 with little change by 11/11. At WRF B, estimated loads declined to the limit of detection on 11/9 but increased to >500,000 copies per liter for both gene targets by 11/11. WRF C loads increased through both sampling dates. Of note, both gene targets were detected this week, with notable increases in the N2 gene (which was largely below the limit of detection last week).  

The 7-day running average of daily reported cases (PCR confirmed) in Athens-Clarke County has increased slightly in the last week to an average of 31 cases per day as of 11/12.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>


##### Nov 2 & 4

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Site update announcement:</span>    
Beginning November 2, 2020, data from all three plants is being reported on this site. Data summaries have been updated to include the third plant (WRF C) back to July 5, 2020. Therefore, charts for ‘data trends’ and ‘all data’ may vary slightly from previously posted reports because of this inclusion; although, in part because WRF C is small compared to the other two plants, trends changed little with this update.  

Going forward, we will begin sampling twice weekly at the three WRFs with support from Athens-Clarke County. We will update this site with any anticipated changes in timing of our data reporting.   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 2 & 4 data update:</span>
This week, we are reporting concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater collected from two sampling events (~6:30 am Sunday Nov 1 to ~ 6:30 am Monday Nov. 2 and ~6:30 am Tuesday Nov. 3 to ~6:30 am Wednesday Nov. 4, 2020). The increased sampling frequency is intended to improve the resolution of our data.    

This week, there was a notable difference in the trends based on the two gene targets, with viral gene copies attributed to the N1 gene increasing slightly (especially at WRF B) or staying steady and viral gene copies attributed to the N2 gene declining (with most samples at or below the limit of our detection). Detection rates of the two genes can vary, especially in wastewater; therefore, it is important to consider results of these targets together. In combination, we think that these results suggest SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 loads are stable or may be declining   

The 7-day running average of reported cases (PCR confirmed) in Athens-Clarke County has remained steady at 22 - 24 new cases per day.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### October 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 27</span>    
Concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in Athens-Clarke County wastewater are comparable to those reported during the previous week (October 20, 2020). Concentrations are also similar between the two plants. These data suggest that there may be persistent viral shedding throughout the community. Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County have been stable over the past three weeks, with a 7-day running averages of 20-24 cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 20</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations in Athens-Clarke County wastewater showed a consistent upward trend this week. WRF A continued its increase from the prior week with concentrations reaching as high as 1 million copies per L. Concentrations at WRF B increased from the below the limit of detection to >300,000 copies per L. The continued upward trends may suggest changes in viral shedding within the community.  

Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County have been stable over the week, with a 7-day running average of 20-30 cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 13</span>    
Trends in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations in Athens wastewater were split this week between the two sampled plants. During the collection period (Oct 12 – 13), viral RNA concentrations at WRF B declined to at or below the limit of detection. However, levels at WRF A increased to >500,000 copies per L, after declining to near the limit of detection the prior week. It is too early to know if the increased SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 signal at WRF A is indicative of possible uptick in transmission or due to inherent variability in sample collection. If there is increased transmission, we would expect to see the trend in wastewater continue next week as well as an increase in reported cases.  

Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County have remained stable for the last 2 weeks (7-day running average between 21 and 24 new cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 6</span>    
Levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 continue to decrease in wastewater samples collected from Athens-Clarke County. These results are consistent with the decrease in the number of newly-reported cases over the past two weeks.   

It is important to note that the levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus have decreased to or at the limit of detection for our current method. Our theoretical limit of detection is approximately 3,570 copies/L. Below this concentration, viruses may be not be detected or quantified with accuracy.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### September 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 29</span>    
Overall SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations continued to decline in sewage reaching Athens's WRFs, in line with decreasing reported cases in Athens-Clarke County. The decline was especially evident at WRF A, where levels were at or below the limit of detection for our methods. However, concentrations at WRF B were virtually unchanged from last week.  

With our current process, we cannot accurately detect virus concentrations below about 3,000 copies per L. Therefore, we cannot assume that a sample that is 'below the limit of detection' is negative for SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2, rather it may be at some level that we cannot accurately determine with our current method. Our lab is evaluating different detection options that may improve detection during times with lower levels of circulating virus.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 22</span>    
Concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 declined this week in wastewater collected from both WRFs. Average levels remain above 100,000 copies/L. This decline is consistent with declines in reported cases in Athens-Clarke County.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 15</span>    
This week, the level SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 continued to exceed 1 million copies of virus per liter of sewage. While the 7-day running average of new cases has declined in Athens-Clarke County, there were no significant changes in the level of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus in wastewater, compared to those observed on September 9, 2020.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 8</span>    
This week, levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 for both targets at both plants continued to exceed 1 million copies of virus per liter of sewage. Average values were similar to concentrations from the prior week (September 1, 2020) with virtually no change in the average levels at WRF B and a 6% reduction at WRF A.  

An important note about sample collection this week was that it occurred over the Labor Day holiday and may explain the slight reduction in viral concentration at the WRF A plant. Samples were collected between ~6:30 am Monday through 6:30 am Tuesday. The volume of wastewater flowing into WRF A decreased from 5.73 million gallons on September 1, 2020 to 4.96 million gallons on September 8, 2020. The collection area for WRF A includes the UGA main campus and Downtown Athens. We suspect that this week's data point reflects the real-time effect of population movement on viral levels in wastewater. In other words, a closed campus and likely large number of people traveling reduces the input. Samples collected on a particular day reflect the inputs of that day and not necessarily the entire week.  

Our trend analysis suggests a continued elevation in total viral load (see data trends tab).  

Daily reported cases in Athens-Clarke County continue to rise, now reaching a 7-day moving average of 126.1 new cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 1</span>    
This week continues the trend of the past month with SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations increasing in wastewater. Levels increased to their highest point since the beginning of data collection with average concentrations for both plants and both targets exceeding 3 million copies of virus per liter of sewage, approximately 10-fold higher than the prior week. Daily reported cases in Clarke County also continued to rise reaching a 7-day moving average of >74 cases per day.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### August 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Aug 25</span>    
SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in Athens-Clarke County wastewater increased slightly in this week's samples (reaching >900,000 copies of the virus per liter of sewage). This moderate increase continues the upward trend observed over the prior three weeks. Reported cases have remained steady through the week (8/18 - 8/25/2020) averaging ~30 new cases per day.

On August 18, 2020, the concentration of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 increased to over 100,000 copies per liter for both gene targets. This uptick is somewhat reflected in the daily reported cases for Athens-Clarke county and may indicate further increases in the coming weeks.  

Furthermore, this week marks the return of approximately 30,000 undergraduate students to the UGA main campus for the start of the fall semester.

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Prior to Aug 18, 2020</span>    
Weekly analyses of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in sewage began June 16, 2020, at which time concentrations were below the current method limit of detection and new cases were reported at <10 per day. Reported cases began to increase to >20 per day in late June and SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentration  increased to up to 10 million viral copies per liter. Sewage concentrations were steady through mid-July inline with newly reported cases averaging 35 per day. Beginning July 21, 2020 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations in sewage began to decline through early August, while concurrent case report remained high. We suspect that this decline possibly preceded the decline in cases noted in late August, which may be due to lags in testing results and case reporting.  

Since August 4, 2020 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentration has steadily increased for both the N1 and N2 gene targets. This suggests that sewage concentrations may be a leading indicator for new cases in the community, but more data collection and  monitoring of delays in testing reports will be needed to confirm this trend.

### Individual Plants {.tabset}

Three plants service the Athens-Clarke County region. WRF A serves the largest portion of the community (including all of UGA main campus and downtown Athens), followed by WRF B (including areas west of Milledge Ave.), and WRF C (including Athens Eastside). Total capacity at WRF C is substantially smaller than the other two plants; this plant also receives periodic waste from pumped septic system and ‘port-o-potties’, which may lead to increased variability over time. Load and trends over time are shown for each service area. Trend analyses follow the same procedure as noted in ‘Data Trends’ tab.

This chart provides the concentration for SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 at each of three plants in Athens-Clarke County for each sampling period. ymbols represent the mean concentration for the two viral gene targets at each of the three plants. Therefore, each sampling date includes six data points (2 gene targets x 3 plants).   

Samples are collected once weekly as a 24-hour composite sample at each plant. We measure the virus by detecting two genes specific to SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2, the N1 and N2 nucleocapsid genes, using RT-qPCR. The N1 and N2 gene targets are measured and reported as a concentration, in number of gene copies per liter of wastewater for each plant. The theoretical Limit of Detection (LOD) is noted with a dashed line.    

The daily number of newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases in Athens-Clarke County (purple bars) appear alongside the 7-day moving average of new cases (yellow line).

### Research Overview 

#### Purpose

Wastewater-based surveillance is an emerging tool for monitoring disease outbreaks. Coupled with clinical surveillance, wastewater surveillance can be used to help understand trends in viruses circulating within local population.  

To better understand the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID&#8209;19) on a local level, we are monitoring wastewater samples from water reclamation facilities in Athens, GA. Wastewater samples are collected weekly and tested to detect the disease-causing virus, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2.  

Each sample is a composite of the wastewater received by the water reclamation facility in a single 24-hour period. By examining these samples, we are capturing a snapshot into the health of the entire community that contributes to the sewershed. This wastewater-based research provides a new approach to epidemiology; sewage surveillance may be used to help understand potential burden of disease at a community-scale and trends in viral prevalence (indicating shifts in transmission), without extensive clinical sampling. These data should be considered complementary to on-going clinical testing.  

We are sharing here some of the preliminary results of our wastewater monitoring program. Our objective is to critically examine the use of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 wastewater-based epidemiology for the detection and surveillance of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in our local community.  

We are developing and evaluating our methods in real-time. We will share with you our weekly results and newest developments. This data is intended to complement clinical-based COVID&#8209;19 surveillance data, that will together, inform public health decisions.

#### Methods

Since May 2020, sewage samples have been collected weekly from the three water reclamation facilities (WRFs) that serve Athens-Clarke County. Samples are collected from a 24-hour composite of the influent wastewater received by each WRF.  

Samples are processed by the Lipp Laboratory at the University of Georgia (Department of Environmental Health Science) to detect and measure the abundance of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus in wastewater.

Viral RNA, the genetic material of the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus, is extracted from each sample using the <a href="https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/diagnostics-and-clinical-research/sample-processing/qiaamp-viral-rna-mini-kit/#orderinginformation" target="_blank">QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit.</a>

The viral RNA is then measured using Real-Time RT-PCR Assays, following the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/guidance/f-lab/assays.html" target="_blank">CDC's test protocol </a> for the N1 and N2 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 nucleocapsid genes. 

The N1 and N2 gene targets are measured and reported as a concentration per liter of wastewater (shown in ‘All Data’). N1 and N2 concentrations are then averaged and multiplied by the incoming flow at each plant to determine a total viral load per sampling day.  

Reported case data for COVID-19 has been collected from <a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report" target="_blank">Georgia's Department of Public Health</a> and summarized by Mark Ebell, MD, MS <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS701zSLS_VgpMUVSuGWI89Y05Yev3QCCF-l0nbwtSN1tE-hGlMV1T2Tg0GFVuiVD010szZ1ukr7vnM/pubhtml" target="_blank">here</a>.
