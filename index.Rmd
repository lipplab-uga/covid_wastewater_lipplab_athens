This dashboard provides weekly updates of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 (the virus that causes COVID&#8209;19) levels in wastewater for Athens-Clarke County (ACC). Wastewater sampling can detect viruses that may be shed in feces from infected people within an entire community, including those that are presymptomatic and asymptomatic. This offers a method of estimating trends in community-scale circulation of COVID&#8209;19 that does not rely on clinical or surveillance testing of individuals. Although we cannot currently use wastewater-based testing to estimate a specific number of people infected in a community, it can be used to understand trends and to anticipate potential increases in cases.

### Data Trends

The trendline below reflects the estimated total viral load of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in the combined sewershed of Athens-Clarke County (the service area for all three plants) (top chart) over time. The daily number of newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases in Athens-Clarke County (purple bars) appear alongside the 7-day moving average of new cases (yellow line) (bottom chart). We are using these data to estimate how changes in the concentration of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater may reflect the community trends of circulating COVID&#8209;19 infections.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

**Note about chart and methods**.    
The viral load estimated is based on the average concentration of the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 gene copies per liter of wastewater (as determined by the N1 and N2 viral nucleocapsid genes) x the total flow of wastewater over the sampling day. Both genes target the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 genome but have slight differences in how they perform in our tests; therefore, we are averaging them to simplify the interpretation of the viral load. The trend lines were calculated using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS, span = 0.25). The error associated with these estimates (the 95% confidence interval) is displayed as the shaded area. To further optimize workflow, on 7/19/2021 we have moved our analysis to a new qPCR machine which has resulted in improved precision from this date onward.

##### Apr 25 & 27
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update: **</span>**In looking over the past 3-4 weeks in Athens-Clarke County, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels have slowly increased. This small but steady climb has not been easy to tease out week-to-week and we have reported that levels remained stable. We are not seeing the rapid rise in viral load that we have noted in prior surges but over time it is evident that levels have risen when compared to the recent lows noted in mid-March. This week we continue to see levels that we interpret as ‘stable’ based on the average load for this week compared to the average load for last week, but this is in the context of what appears to be slowly increasing levels overall. As of 4/27/2022, the 7-day running average of newly reported cases in Athens-Clarke County was 5 cases per day.**  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 18</span>    
Total SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load increased slightly from the prior sample (4/20). Levels increased at WRF A (UGA, downtown, northern Athens) and B (west of Milledge Ave) reaching ~136,000 copies per liter and >85,000 copies per liter, respectively. Levels remained elevated at WRF C (east side) at ~263,000 copies per liter but were lower than levels observed on 4/20.     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 20</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 loads for all plants combined declined slightly compared to the Monday sample. Levels declined at both WRF A and B (and were below the limit of detection at WRF A). Levels increased at WRF C to ~497,000 copies per liter, the highest concentration since February.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Apr 18 & 20
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span>**SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load remains stable. This week, there was consistent agreement between the Monday and Wednesday estimates. Averaged across the week, loads were comparable to the previous week’s average. These observations are consistent with reported cases. As of 4/20, the 7-day running average of new cases reported in Athens-Clarke County appear to remain stable at 6 cases per day.**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 18</span>    
Total SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 load decreased from the previous collection date (4/13), driven primarily by a decrease in viral concentrations at WRF A. Even though viral concentrations at WRF A spiked to ~375,000 copies per Liter on 4/13, they declined to ~40,000 copies per Liter on 4/18. Viral loads at WRF B and WRF C remained virtually unchanged from the previous sample (~200,000 copies per Liter and ~70,000 copies per Liter, respectively).  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 20</span>    
Total viral load on Wednesday was comparable to the load from Monday’s collection on 4/18. There were slight fluctuations in viral concentration at each WRF. Viral concentrations were stable at WRF A (~50,000 copies per Liter) but decreased slightly at WRF B, down ~200,000 to ~50,000 copies per Liter. Viral levels notably increased at WRF C, from ~70,000 copies per Liter to ~300,000 copies per Liter.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Apr 11 & 13
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 load for the week across all plants increased this week compared to last. This was consistent for both sampling days, and was largely due to increase load at WRF B (receives wastewater from areas west of Milledge Ave.) and a single day increase at WRF A (wastewater from UGA, downtown, and northern areas of Athens). Unlike the prior week, both SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 gene targets (N1 and N2) were detected in all samples. We are still considering levels to be steady but are keeping watch to determine whether we may be seeing the start of an inflection point. As of 4/15, the 7-day running average of new cases reported in Athens-Clarke County increased slightly to 5 per day.**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 11</span>    
Total SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 load was virtually unchanged from the prior sample (collected 4/6); however, there was notable variability in concentrations between facilities. In particular, the concentration (and load) increased substantially at WRF B from ~8,400 copies per liter on 4/6 to ~63,000 copies per liter on 4/11. Levels and loads changed slightly at WRF A and C. Overall load reached the 20th %-ile of all samples collected to date.            
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 13</span>    
Total load increased substantially in the Wednesday sample. This was due to increases in concentration at both WRF B (to ~238,000 copies per liter) and WRF A (to ~375,000 copies per liter). There was little change at WRF C. Overall load reached the 44th %-ile. Although this was a large jump, it is not yet clear if this is the start of a trend or a single high observation.     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Note for the week</span>    
In effort to better visualize the data as our total samples increase, beginning this week we have decreased the span value of our LOESS smoothing from 0.3 to 0.25. This change will be retroactively applied to all figures in the website.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Apr 4 & 6
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 loads in wastewater remain stable and low, at the bottom 13th percentile of all samples analyzed to date. Reported cases also remain low. As of 4/7/2022, the 7-day running average was 3 reported cases.**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 4</span>    
The total viral load declined slightly compared to samples collected on 3/31. Viral concentrations declined at each plant. Viral loads at WRF A declined from ~100,000 to ~43,000 copies per liter. Viral concentrations at WRF B declined from ~62,800 copies per liter to ~8,000 copies per liter. At WRF C, concentrations declined from 30,000 to ~7,840 copies per liter. Notably, viral concentrations fell below the limit of detection for one of our targets (N2) across all plants.       

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Apr 6</span>    
Compared to Monday’s samples, the total load increased slightly. Viral levels declined again at WRF A to ~33,800 copies per Liter. Viral levels at WRF B remained consistent at ~8,400 copies per liter and increased significantly at WRF C to ~86,400 copies per liter. It is important to note that while there is intra-day and intra-sample variability, total viral loads remain low and stable across all plants. The weekly average total viral load for the county is comparable to observations from the previous week.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### March 2022
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 load in wastewater remained similar to last week. However, unlike last week, when load was driven largely by high levels at WRF C (east side), levels at WRF C declined slightly, while those at WRF A (UGA, downtown, and northern parts of Athens) and WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.) increased. Although reported cases remain low, there was a slight increase this week with a 7-day running average of 4 new cases per day as of (3/31) after reaching as low as one new case per day late last week.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 30</span>    
Across all plants combined, total load increased compared to the Monday sample. Once again, levels declined at WRF C but increased at WRF A and B. Levels at WRF C were ~31,000 copies per liter, ~63,000 copies per liter at WRF B, and reached a high of ~107,000 copies per liter at WRF A (the highest level at this plant since early February). 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 28</span>    
Total load across all three plants combined declined slightly in the Monday sample. Among the plants, levels declined at WRF C (to ~39,000 copies per liter) from >288,000 in the prior sample. Levels increased at WRF A to >10,000 copies per liter (from below the limit of detection in the prior sample) and to >50,000 copies per liter at WRF B.       

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Averaged for the week and across all plants, the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 load increased slightly compared to last week, but this seems to continue the stable but noisy pattern that we have seen over the last three weeks. However, it is worth noting that the load this week is largely due to consistent and high detection rates at WRF C (services the east side of Athens). Levels at both WRF A (UGA, down town, and northern parts of Athens) and WRF B (west of Milledge Ave) have been relatively low. We have noted in our updates over the last three weeks that levels on the eastside have been high or trending up. This may indicate 1) increased transmission levels within this part of Athens, 2) possible contribution from outside of Athens (WRF C receives septic pump outs from other counties but the contribution is a very small fraction of the total amount of waste at the plant), and/or 3) characteristics of the waste itself (WRF C is primarily residential whereas WRF A and B have more industrial and non-residential input that can sometime dilute the residential signal). Case rates for the county have remained stable and low with a 7-day running average of 2 new cases per day as of 3/23/2022.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 23</span>    
Load was similar to the Monday sample, with SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 from WRF C again being the main contributor to the total load. Levels at WRF C were ~288,000 copies per liter. Levels at WRF B increased to ~10,000 copies per liter. At WRF A, levels declined to below the limit of detection.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 21</span>    
The total load for Monday 3/21 was similar to the load observed during the prior sample (3/16) but there was considerable variability in levels between plants, with WRF C being the primary contributor. WRF C increased to ~364,000 copies per liter (from ~99,000 on 3/16). At WRF A, levels were stable compared to the prior week (~26,000 copies per liter compared to ~29,000 on 3/16). Levels at WRF B were below the limit of detection. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Following the increase in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 load in last week’s wastewater samples, this week’s data are quite variable. Viral levels declined to below the limit of detection on Monday. Levels increased again on Wednesday, but were slightly lower than last week. We have seen this type of variability in viral load when case rates are low. At this point, there is no clear trend in viral load. There is no clear inflection point to indicate that viral loads are increasing or decreasing. Thus, for now, the viral load appears to be steady.This is also consistent with reported case rates that have remained at ~3 new cases per day (7-day running average) for the last week.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 16</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA was detected at all plants, despite dilution from rainfall during the sample collection. Concentrations were highest at WRF C (east side, where levels have been increasing consistently over the last few weeks) at ~99,000 copies per liter (but down from the 3/9 levels of ~360,000 copies per liter). At WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and northern areas of Athens), levels increased to >29,000 copies per liter (from ~14,000 copies per liter on 3/9). Levels at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.) were ~9,000 copies per liter (declining from the >37,000 copies per liter on 3/9).  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 14</span>    
Levels at all plants were below the limit of detection for the Monday samples (collection period 6:30 am 3/13 to 6:30 am 3/14). This was the last day of UGA’s spring break but flows into WRFs were at normal levels.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **For the first time in 8 weeks, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA loads increased on average for the week. Total loads across the county are still relatively low (27th %ile for the week) but this represents a distinct break from the recent trends (last week we were at the 6th %ile for load). As we have noted before, we will not know if this is a trend until additional samples are collected. We have previously noted that during low case counts, levels in wastewater tend to be more variable. But these data are certainly worth taking seriously as it could suggest that our infection rates are plateauing or potentially rising. As of 3/10/2022, the 7-day running average of newly reported cases (which generally lag wastewater loads) in Athens-Clarke County was 3 new cases per day.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 9</span>    
Loads increased again from the Monday sample, with SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 detected in all samples (none were below the limit of detection). Levels increased at both WRF A (to ~14,000 copies per liter) and WRF C (to ~360,000 copies per liter), but declined to ~38,000 copies per liter at WRF B.   
     
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 7</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 loads increased for all plants combined, but this was driven by a large spike at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.). WRF B was below the limit of detection at the last sample collection (3/2) but increased to >230,000 copies per liter in the Monday sample. Levels declined modestly at WRF C (east side) from ~77,000 copies per liter on 3/2 to ~60,000 copies per liter on 3/7. At WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and northern areas of the county), levels fell from ~18,000 copies per liter on 3/2 to below the limit of detection on Monday. It is worth noting that flows to WRF A were very low for the Monday sample, likely due to a smaller population on the UGA campus with the start of spring break.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA load continued to decline this week, with levels approaching the limit of detection at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.). We are currently at levels not observed since June 2021. As of 3/2/2022, the 7-day running average of new cases in Athens-Clarke County was 6 new cases per day.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Mar 1</span>    
Levels were relatively stable on the Wednesday 3/1 sample compared to the Monday (2/28) sample. Concentrations and load remained steady at WRF A, declined at WRF B (to below the limit of detection), and increased at WRF C (to ~76,000 copies per liter).    
     
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### Febuary 2022

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 28</span>    
On average, samples collected on Monday 2/28 showed declining levels from the prior week, with concentrations and loads declining at both WRF A and WRF B. Concentrations at WRF C (east side) increased from the prior sample (2/23) from ~12,000 copies per liter to ~36,000 copies per liter (but still relatively low in comparison to earlier this year). 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The total viral load of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA continues to decline across Athens, GA. Averaged across all samples collected this week, the total viral load is in the bottom 10% of estimates to date. Reported case counts for Athens-Clarke County fell to a 7-day running average of 12 new cases per day as of 2/21/2022.**      

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 23</span>    
The total viral load declined in the Wednesday sample collected 2/23, as viral concentrations declined substantially at each WRF. Viral concentrations could be affected rain events this week, diluting the viral signal in wastewater samples.    
     
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 21</span>    
Viral RNA loads for Monday 2/21 were similar to the previous sample collected on 2/16. Viral concentrations increased at WRF A from 17,500 copies/L to 44,700 copies/L, while concentrations at WRF B decreased from 100,000 copies/L to 31,800 copies/L. Concentrations at WRF C remained stable at ~70,000 copies/L.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA levels averaged across all plants continued to decline this week. Loads at WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and north Athens) reached levels not observed since last summer. Declines in load were more modest at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.) and WRF C (east side), but reached levels similar to those noted in late November. WRF B also continued to have the highest load of all three plants. Reported case counts for Athens-Clarke County fell to a 7-day running average of 19 new cases per day as of 2/17/2022.**      

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 14</span>    
Loads declined substantially in the Wednesday 2/16 sample across all plants. Among the plants, loads declined at both WRF A and C but were stable at WRF B. Concentrations declined to ~17,000 copies per liter at WRF A and ~69,000 copies per liter at WRF A; levels at WRF B were ~100,000 copies per liter.  
     
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 12</span>    
Viral RNA loads for Monday 2/14 were similar to the previous sample collected on 2/9. The total at WRF C increased substantially but was offset by declines at both WRF A and B. The concentration at WRF C was >425,000 copies per liter (compared to the previous sample of >120,000 copies per liter). Levels were ~88,000 copies per liter at WRF B and ~26,000 copies per liter at WRF C.            

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA loads continue to decline across all plants this week. The largest decline was observed at WRF C (east side). While levels are trending down, the highest loads were noted for WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.), which has been the case for most of this surge. Reported case counts for Athens-Clarke County also continued to fall, reaching a 7-day running average of 39 new cases per day as of 2/10/2022.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 9</span>    
Viral levels were stable compared to the Monday (2/7) sample, with a very slight decline at WRF C and slight increases at WRF A and B.
     
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 7</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels declined substantially at all plants. The steepest decline was at WRF C (to ~110,000 copies per liter, from >400,000 copies per liter in the prior sample), followed by WRF A (to only ~40,000 copies per liter, from ~88,000 copies per liter), and finally WRF B (~167,000 copies per liter, from ~278,000 copies per liter).          

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **While SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA levels remain high in wastewater, loads for the week showed a consistent decline. Averaged for the week and across all plants, viral load declined to the ~50th%ile for all samples collected to date, reaching levels not observed since last December. Levels declined at both WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.) and C (eastside) for the week, and were stable at WRF A (UGA, downtown, and northern parts of Athens) compared to last week. Reported case counts also fell to a 7-day running average of 79 new cases per day as of 2/3/2022.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Omicron Variant Update</span>    
Although we have not been reporting on specific variants, we have been tracking the BA1 omicron subvariant through this winter surge. We began to consistently observe this variant in Athens wastewater beginning the week of December 6, 2021, which coincided with the sharper uptick of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 load in general and preceded the sharp rise in cases which began around 12/15/2021.

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Feb 2</span>    
Viral levels declined across all plants. Concentrations reached ~88,000 copies per liter at WRF A, ~278,000 copies per liter at WRF B, and ~417,000 copies per liter at WRF C.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### January 2022
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 31</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load for all three plants combined was nearly identical to the load recorded for the prior sample (Wednesday Jan 26). This reflected a modest decline in levels at both WRF B (to ~890,000 viral copies per liter) and WRF C (to ~455,000 viral copies per liter) and an increase at WRF A (to ~309,000 viral copies per liter).        
     
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **For the third week in a row, the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA load in Athens wastewater has remained steady when averaged for the week and across all three WRFs. Levels are still very high, indicating continued transmission, but we are seeing some variability between plants this week. Levels at WRF C (east side) increased substantially for the week (mostly due to high load on Monday) and were stable at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.). However, loads at WRF A (UGA, downtown, northern areas of Athens),  clearly declined compared to last week. We should know by next week if this is the start of a declining trend. As of January 27, there was a 7-day running average of 168 new cases reported in Athens Clarke-County, down from 223 reported one week ago.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 26</span>    
Total viral load for  Wednesday January 26  declined from the Monday sample, with differences between the individual plants. At WRF A, levels declined slightly to 85,000 copies per liter. Levels at WRF C declined to ~800,000 copies per liter. At WRF B, levels increased slightly to ~1 million copies per liter.      

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 24</span>    
Viral load, for all plants combined, increased on Monday 1/24 relative to the prior week and reached the 85th%ile for all samples collected to date. While the overall load increased, there were distinct differences between the individual plants. Levels at WRF C increased to >3.8 million viral genome copies per liter (from over 1 million copies per liter on Wed Jan 20). The increase at this plant was largely responsible for the increased load overall. Levels at WRF B declined to ~950,000 copies per liter (from 1.1 million last week). Levels at WRF C declined substantially to 110,000 copies per liter (from ~635,000 last week).

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Averaged across all plants for the week, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral loads remained stable compared to the prior week. This is the second week of stable loads, but levels remain very high, indicating that active transmission is on-going. DPH reported a 7-day running average of 223 new cases per day as of 1/20/2022.**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 19</span>    
For the Wednesday samples, levels were similar to the prior day at both WRF A (>600,00 copies per liter) and WRF B (>1 million copies per liter), but increased to >1 million copies per liter at WRF C.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 18</span>    
Due to the MLK holiday, samples were collected on Tuesday this week rather than Monday (sample was collected between 6:30 am Monday 1/17 and 6:30 am Tuesday 1/18). For all plants, levels remained consistent compared with the prior sample. Concentrations at WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and northern areas) were >600,000 copies per liter, at WRF C (east side) concentrations were >700,000 copies per liter, and at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave) concentrations continued to exceed 1 million copies per liter.
   
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **After several weeks of steadily increasing, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral loads have appeared to level off at approximately 10^13 total copies. The total viral load still remains in the top ~84th percentile of all observations to date. According to DPH, the 7-day running average of newly reported cases is 244 (1/13/2022).**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 12</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral loads remain leveled-off. There is strong agreement between the total viral load estimated for the Monday (1/10) and Wednesday (1/12) samples collected this week. Concentrations at WRF A decreased slightly to 693,000 copies per liter, while concentrations at WRF B increased slightly to 1.41 million copies per liter. Concentrations at WRF C remain right at ~1.5 million copies per liter. The flow-adjusted total viral load remains at approximately 10^13 total copies across the county’s sewer shed.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 10</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral loads have leveled off at all three plants. Concentrations at WRF A remain around 850,000 copies per liter. At WRF B, concentrations declined from 1.14 million copies per liter to 840,000 copies per liter, but when adjusting for influent flow, the total viral load remained consistent with last week’s sample. The concentration and total viral load at WRF C was consistent with observations from last weeks sample, ~1.5 million copies per liter and 10^13 total copies.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Viral RNA load averaged for the week (two sample days this week) reached levels not observed since January 2021 and was higher than 93% of all samples collected to date (since June 2020). Despite heavy rains, and likely dilution effects resulting from that, concentrations averaged over 1 million copies per liter from all plants. These observations reflect a very high rate of transmission within our community. Case report data from DPH shows a 7-day running average of 191 new cases per day as of 1/5/2022 (these numbers may be updated as there have been reported issues and delays with the DPH reports).**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 5</span>    
Viral load for Wednesday declined slightly at all plants compared to the Monday sample, but remained high compared to recent samples (i.e., loads exceeded those of the past two weeks and exceeded the 86th %ile of samples collected to date). Wastewater flows also remained elevated from recent rains and dilution effects are likely still an issue. However, concentrations remain high with >826,000 copies per liter at WRF A (UGA, downtown, and north Athens), 1.14 million copies per liter at WRF B, and 1.27 million copies per liter at WRF C.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Jan 3</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load increased substantially at all three plants, despite high wastewater flows due to heavy rains over the weekend. Typically, the infiltration of rainwater into the sewer lines dilutes the wastewater as it arrives at plant. Despite this dilution effect, concentrations were over 1 million copies per liter at all plants (ranging from 1.13 million copies per liter at WRF C (east side) to 1.79 million copies per liter at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave). The overall load for Monday’s sample exceeded that of >97% of samples collected to date.

##### December 2021
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update Dec 27:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA loads continue to increase this week. This sample was collected between 6:30 am on Sunday 12/26 and 6:30 am 12/27, when wastewater flows coming into each plant were much lower than average, indicating a lower population density in Athens-Clarke county over the holiday weekend. Despite reduced wastewater flow, total load for all plants doubled compared to last week (sampled on 12/20) and reached a weekly level not observed since the end of August. Load is calculated as the flow into the plant x concentration; therefore, it is important to note that this load reflects an extremely high concentration of viral RNA (all three WRFs had >900,000 copies per liter, and WRF B reached almost 2 million copies per liter). We have not observed concentrations at this level, over all three plants, since last winter/spring.**    

**Reported case rates also continue to climb in Athens-Clarke County, with the 7-day running average of 89 new cases per day as of 12/28. We do not yet know how the increased use of at-home rapid tests may affect reliability of official case reports (and another reason to watch wastewater trends as we move into this next surge).**    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div> 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Note for the week</span>    
_For this week and next, samples will only be collected on Monday to allow our lab crew to take some time off over the holidays. We will be back to twice weekly collections the first week of January._

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update Dec 20:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load declined from the very high level reported last Wednesday (which was largely due to a spike at WRF B) but remains elevated compared to recent weeks. We see this as a continued increasing trend. Loads have continued to increase steadily at WRF C (east side), marking the 5th sampling in a row with rising levels. WRF B (west of Milledge) has been highly variable and after reaching very high levels last week, declined in this week’s sample. After some recent declines, loads at WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, north Athens) increased by >10-fold, reaching levels not observed since mid-October. Cases continue to steadily rise in Athens-Clarke county, with 20 new cases per day (7-day running average) as of 12/21.**  

**While week to week wastewater loads have been variable over the past six weeks, on average, virus levels in wastewater have been increasing since mid-November and continue to be elevated. We encourage continued caution as we enter the holiday season.**

**Happy holidays to all and stay safe!**

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div> 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **After a short leveling off last week, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels in Athens-Clarke County have increased again. Averaged for the week, loads increased nearly 10-fold compared to last week. This was largely attributable to consistently increasing loads at  WRF C (east side) (both days) and a large spike in load at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.) in the Wednesday sample. Viral load at WRF A (UGA, downtown and north Athens) has remained stable (although total flow at this plant has declined somewhat as people may be leaving Athens for the holiday break). As of 12/16, reported cases in Athens-Clarke County increased to 14 cases per day (7-day running average) (from 11 new cases per day reported at the end of last week). SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels in wastewater have been generally increasing since Thanksgiving, which we are now starting to see in case reports.**      

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Dec 15</span>    
Overall, load from the Wednesday sample increased substantially (reaching the 89th %ile for load since the start of monitoring). While levels declined at WRF A (to ~21,000 copies per liter), they increased at WRF C (>281,000 copies per liter) and especially at WRF B (>4 million copies per liter).        

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Dec 13</span>    
Loads in the Monday samples were more or less stable compared to the prior collection, with modest increases noted at WRF A and WRF C (increasing to >174,000 and >111,000 copies per liter, respectively). Levels declined slightly at WRF B (to ~51,000 copies per liter).       

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **After two weeks of increasing loads of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA in wastewater, levels declined this week to pre-Thanksgiving levels (similar weekly average load during the week of 11/14). Total loads declined across all plants on Monday followed by an increase at all plants for the Wednesday sample. For the week, the load was highest at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave) and WRF A (UGA, downtown, and north Athens) and lowest at WRF C (east side). Reported cases remain low in Athens-Clarke County, but increased to a 7-day running average of 11 cases per day (up from 7 per day last week).**       

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Dec 8</span>    
Levels increased at all plants relative to the Monday sample. Concentrations were >81,000 copies per liter at WRF C, ~290,000 copies per liter at WRF B, and >135,000 copier per liter at WRF A.         

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div> 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Dec 6</span>    
Total viral load at all plants declined compared to the prior (12/1) sample. Levels at WRF C were below the limit of detection. Concentrations at WRF A reached just over 30,000 copies per liter. At WRF B, concentrations declined but remain relatively high at ~184,000 copies per liter.       

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div> 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load this week continued an upward trend, with average viral loads increasing at WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and north Athens) and WRF C (east side). The highest load, averaged for the week, was at WRF C, followed by WRF A, and WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.) which showed a decrease compared to the large spike noted the week prior (11/22). As of Thursday 12/2, the 7-day running average of new cases in Athens-Clarke County was 7 per day, unchanged from last week; but the continued increase in wastewater loads suggests that transmission is likely increasing in our area.**       

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Dec 1</span>    
Total load increased substantially across the area by Wednesday, with load and concentrations increasing at all three plants. Concentrations were especially high at WRF C (reaching >2 million copies per liter), followed by WRF B (>300,000 copies per liter), and WRF A (>215,000 copies per liter).         

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

##### November 2021

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Nov 29</span>    
Total load declined in the Monday sample collection compared to the prior collection (11/21). This decline was attributed to a lower viral load at WRF B (which had reached extremely high levels the prior week). Levels at both WRF A and WRF C increased relative to the prior sample. Concentrations at all plants were between ~140,000 and 160,000 copies per liter. It is worth noting that this sample collection began at 6:30 am on Sunday 11/28 and may reflect a lower population due to out of town travel for the Thanksgiving break. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Samples were only collected on Monday 11/22 this week (no Wednesday sample), allowing our lab crew to take a much needed Thanksgiving break. Last week we noted that levels had trended up as of the Wednesday 11/17 collection, indicating a possible shift from the stable levels noted for the past several weeks. This week, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA continued to rise as of 11/22, reaching the 80th percentile of viral load to date (viral load is the concentration across all plants normalized to their flow rate).**     

**This was a sharp upward trend and suggests that reported cases may begin rising in the area. However, this shift was not county wide, rather it was due to increasing concentrations specifically at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.), where levels have been rising consistently for the last 3 weeks. Levels at WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and north Athens) and WRF C (east side) remained stable compared to the prior week. The concentrations at WRF B reached >2 million copies per liter and was consistent across both of the gene targets (N1 and N2).**     

**Please continue to encourage ventilation in indoor spaces, use portable HEPA filters, and get vaccinated (or boosted) as we head into the holiday weekend. Although reported cases remain low in Athens-Clarke County (at 7 new cases per day, based on the 7-day running average), viral transmission may be on the rise.**       

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels in wastewater have been steady for the past several weeks, consistent with reported case trends in Athens-Clarke County. However, this week has mixed results, with levels on Monday continuing their steady trend from the prior week but increasing at all plants by the Wednesday sample. It will not be clear if this is the beginning of a change in trends until we process samples next week, but it is worth noting. Wastewater load precedes changes in reported cases by 3-5 days, based on our analyses in Athens-Clarke County throughout the pandemic.**       

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Nov 17</span>    
Viral load increased at all plants on Wednesday 11/17, with the greatest change in load at WRF C and A. Concentrations were ~207,000 copies per liter at WRF A, ~115,000 copies per liter at WRF B, and ~170,000 copies per liter at WRF C.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Nov 15</span>    
Samples collected on Monday 11/15 showed viral loads similar to those observed on the prior collection date (11/10), with slight declines at WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and north Athens) and WRF C (east side) and slight increase at WRF B (west of Milledge). Concentrations were ~92,000 copies per liter at WRF A, ~70,000 copies per liter at WRF B, and ~53,000 copies per liter at WRF C.

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA levels in Athens-Clarke County wastewater continue to remain stable. Compared to the prior week, average levels for the week increased at WRF B (west of Milledge Ave.) but declined slightly at both WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and north Athens) and WRF C (east side). Reported cases in the county declined slightly to ~9 cases per day (7-day running average) as of 11/10/2021.**       

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Nov 10</span>    
Levels increased modestly at all plants for the Wednesday 11/10 sample. Concentrations reached ~94,000 copies per liter at WRF A, ~38,000 copies per liter at WRF B, and ~182,000 copies per liter at WRF C.      

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Nov 8</span>    
For the sample collected Monday 11/8, total viral load (all plants) was consistent with the load noted on Nov 3 (Wednesday). There was again some variability between the plants, with substantially higher levels at WRF A (~72,000 copies per liter). Levels were more stable at WRF B and WRF C, with ~25,000 and ~84,000 copies per liter at each plant, respectively.

Reported cases also remain relatively stable at 13 new cases per day (7-day running average) as of 11/4/2021.**     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Nov 3</span>    
Total viral load (across all plants, combined) declined compared to the Monday sample. This was largely attributable to a decline in concentration at WRF A (to ~32,000 copies per liter), the largest plant in Athens-Clarke county. Concentrations increased modestly at both WRF B (to ~15,000 copies per liter) and WRF C (to ~192,000 copies per liter).    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div> 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Nov 1</span>    
Viral loads increased (over all plants, combined) prior to the Wednesday (10/27) sample and were similar to the levels observed on 10/25 (one week earlier). Levels declined slightly at WRF C (to ~164,000 copies per liter) and substantially at WRF B to (~8,700 copies per liter, from >100,000 the prior week). However, the concentration increased to >200,000 copies per liter at WRF A (from ~37,000 in the prior sample).

##### October 2021
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Average SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load for the region again remained stable compared to the prior week. There was a slight decline at WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and north Athens) and slight increase in loads at WRF B (west of Milledge) and WRF C (east side) when averaged for the week. The 7-day running average of new daily cases in Athens-Clarke County declined slightly to 9 as of 10/28/2021.**     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Oct 27</span>    
Concentrations and loads declined modestly across all plants. Levels were stable at WRF C (~198,000 copies per liter) but declined to 103,000 copies per liter at WRF B, and 37,000 copies per liter at WRF A.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div> 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Oct 25</span>    
Viral RNA loads increased slightly in Monday’s sample compared to the prior collection (10/20), driven primarily by an increase at WRF C and a smaller increase at WRF B, with concentrations exceeding 200,000 copies per liter at both plants. The concentration at WRF A declined to ~50,000 copies per liter.

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Oct 20</span>    
Total viral loads declined across all plants combined compared to Monday’s samples. These values were more consistent with the total viral load observed from the previous week. The viral concentration at WRF A declined from 360,000 copies per liter on Monday to 70,000 copies per liter and from 228,000 per liter at WRF C to 146,000 per liter. The total viral load at WRF B remained steady at >150,000 copies per liter.    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Oct 18</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral loads for the day increased substantially compared to the prior week. This was largely due to an increase in concentrations at both WRF A (UGA campus, downtown, and northern Athens) and WRF C (east side), which increased by 10-fold at both plants. However, the concentrations at WRF B (west of Milledge) remained stable at >100,000 copies per liter.

</div>     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **For the third consecutive week, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 loads continued to decline, averaged across all wastewater treatment plants. Average weekly load reached its lowest point since mid-July (when transmission was beginning to increase across the region). This trend is in line with declining reported cases, which reached a 7-day running average of 13 new cases per day as of 10/14/2021. This latest surge and decline follows similar patterns noted in August/September 2020.**     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Oct 13</span>    
Total viral loads continued to decline on Wednesday, driven primarily by reductions at WRF A and C (where concentrations were <30,000 genome copies per liter).  Levels at WRF B remained steady (still exceeding 100,000 copies per liter).   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Methods Update:**</span> Beginning the week of September 27th, 2021 we have revised our data analysis methods to account for improvements in our sample processing hardware and the increased number of total observations. This change is represented as a modification in our LOESS smoothing calculation (used in all "trends" plots) which changes the span from 0.6 to 0.3. This modification was made to better capture the week-to-week fluctuations in wastewater viral load. It should be noted, this modification will retroactively be applied to all previous observations therefore, any "trend" plots may vary slightly from previous data releases. We thank everyone for their continued utilization of these data and welcome any feedback!

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral loads in Athens-Clarke County wastewater showed a clear decline this week. Averaged for the week, loads were lower at all WRFs compared to the week prior; however, there was some variability between the sampling dates as noted below. These data are consistent with declining case reports to the GA DPH, which reached a 7-day running average of 55 new cases per day as of 9/16 (compared to 92 on 9/9). While total loads in wastewater are still in the upper 50% of all samples collected to date and concentrations remain >250,000 copies per liter at all plants, these downwards trends are encouraging. Please continue to keep good ventilation and filtration indoors, wear masks, and get vaccinated if you have not already.**

SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA was detectable at all three facilities on Wednesday 5/12. Viral concentrations at each plant increased compared to samples collected 5/10, and ranged from ~23,000 copies per liter at WRF B to ~49,000 copies per liter at WRF C. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">May 10</span>  
The total viral load on Monday (5/10) was slightly elevated compared to the viral load from the previous sample collected Wednesday, 5/5. SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA was detectable at WRF A and WRF B but fell below the limit of detection at WRF C.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels for the county declined for the second week in a row. For the week, the decline in daily load was noted at all three WRFs. Reported cases in Athens-Clarke county ended the week at 9 new cases per day (7-day running average) and a 7-day positive test rate of 3.4%, similar to reports for the prior week. As of 5/7/2021, 28% of Athens-Clarke county was considered to be fully vaccinated.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">May 5</span>  
Viral loads were below the limit of detection at both WRF A and C, and increased slightly at WRF B. Averaged for all plants, the load declined compared to the Monday (5/2) sample. It is worth noting that wastewater flows were elevated at all plants after the heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday. This could have led to some dilution of the incoming sewage that, in turn, could dilute the viral signal.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">May 3</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA was detected at all three plants but at lower levels than noted for the prior sample date (4/28/2021). Viral concentrations ranged from ~23,000 genome copies per liter at WRF C to ~69,000 copies per liter at WRF A. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### April 2021
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Average viral load declined slightly for the first time in 5 weeks. Average daily load was down at both WRF B and C but increased slightly at WRF A. Daily reported cases in Athens-Clarke County ended the week at 8 (7-day running average), after reaching recent high of 13 new cases per day (7-day average) on 4/19.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 28</span>  
Viral loads for the Wednesday sample increased at all plants, compared to 4/26 (concentration >100,000 copies per liter), but to a lesser extent than has been observed in recent weeks. The 7-day running average of new cases in Athens-Clarke county was 10 on 4/28 with a positive test rate of 3.3% (7-day running average).   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 26</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels at all plants declined compared to the prior sample date (Wednesday, 4/22) but were not as low as had been noted in the prior few weeks’ Monday samples. Viral RNA was detected at all plants with concentrations > 50,000 genome copies per liter. On 4/26, GA DPH reported a 7-day running average of 9 new cases per day and a positive test rate of 3.7% (7-day running average).        

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Viral load results this week look very similar to those noted last week. We observed a large difference between low loads for the Monday sample (4th %-ile), with levels below the limit of detection at WRFs A and C, followed by high loads on Wednesday (80th %-ile). Averaged for the week, levels for all plants combined were similar to last week’s average. This continued trend suggests that significant levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 continue to circulate in Athens-Clarke County, while reported cases have been relatively stable. This may be related to lower rates of testing across the area and potentially more asymptomatic infections (although without surveillance testing to confirm, this is only an assumption). GA DPH reports showed that daily cases ended the week at 12 (7-day running average) in Athens-Clarke County with a 7-day running average positive test rate of 4.8%, a slight increase from last week.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 21</span>  
Viral loads increased at all plants, with the load at WRF B reaching its highest level since mid-January. Loads at WRFs A and C were similar (or lower) than that observed in last week’s Wednesday sample. On 4/21, GA DPH reported 10 new daily cases based on the 7-day running average and a PCR-test positivity of 4.2% (7-day running average).   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 19</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 loads and concentrations declined at all three plants for the sample collected Monday 4/19. Levels were below the limit of detect for WRFs A and C and were detectable, but low, at WRF B. This pattern of low levels on the Monday sample has been common in recent weeks; we are still evaluating additional to data to explain this trend. On 4/19, DPH reported 13 new cases per day using the 7-day running average. The reported test positivity rate reached 10.5% (5.3% based on the 7-day running average).      

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Averaged for the week and across all plants, viral loads were slightly higher but comparable to the prior week’s average. However, there was considerable variability between sampling days this week, with levels below the limit of detection at two plants (A and C) on Monday before reaching high levels on Wednesday (Monday’s samples were in the 3rd percentile for load while those on Wednesday reached the 77th percentile for load). The 7-day running average of new cases per day ended the week at 10 (4/16). The 7-day running average of positive PCR tests in Athens-Clarke county (reported to DPH) was 4%, a decline from the prior week.**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 14</span>  
Viral levels increased substantially on 4/14, reaching over 1 million genome copies per liter at each plant and the highest daily load (all plants combined) since late January.    

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases was 10 as of 4/14 and the 7-day running average of positive PCR tests increased to 4.1% for the county.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 12</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels were below the limit of detection at WRFs A and C but remained stable at WRF B. Rainfall throughout the day Sunday may have contributed to some loss of signal in the wastewater samples, but we have observed over the last month that the detection of virus in the sample collected on Monday is often low for WRF A in particular which may suggest some variability in the wastewater flow over the weekend. This is something that we will be working to investigate.   

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases was 9 as of 4/12 and the 7-day running average of positive PCR tests was 3.7% for Athens-Clarke county (per DPH).     

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Viral RNA levels were comparable to those reported last week. While the total viral load remains relatively low (in the lower third of all concentrations reported) for Athens-Clarke County, a general upward trend has been observed over a period of three weeks. The 7-day running average of reported cases has increased to 12 cases per day as of 4/9 and the rate of positive tests increased to 5% (compared to 4% positivity on 4/2). These trends suggest that there is a continued need for preventative measures as vaccine distribution increases within the county.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 7</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA levels fell below the limit of detection at WRF A, but viral loads at WRF B and WRF C were comparable to observations on Monday (4/5). The running average number of new cases on 4/7 increased to 11.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">April 5</span>  
Levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA were detectable at all three WRFs. The viral load at WRF A increased slightly compared to the previous observation on 3/31. The viral loads at WRF B and WRF C were comparable to those observed in the previous week. The 7-day running average of new cases on 4/5 was 9.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### March 2021
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Averaged for the week, SARS‑CoV‑2 viral RNA levels increased for the second week in a row across the Athens-Clarke County wastewater treatment plants. Average levels increased at all three plants, with moderate increases for the week at WRFs A and B and a substantial increase at WRF C. Although total viral load in wastewater across the area remains relatively low (in the bottom third fraction compared to all samples collected to date), the shift toward increasing levels over the last two weeks (after several weeks of stable to declining levels) is concerning. As of April 2, reported cases remained low in Athens-Clarke County, at 8 new cases per day (7-day running average), but the number of tests administered has declined and the percentage of positive tests has increased slightly (from 3% positive on 3/24 to 4% positive on 4/2** <a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report" target="_blank">7-day running average</a>**)**. **This illustrates the need for continued preventative measures as vaccine distribution increases within the county.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 31</span>  
Levels declined (WRF B) or remained stable (WRF C), compared to the Monday sample, but increased substantially at WRF A.     

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 29</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA levels declined below the limit of detection at WRF A, but increased at both WRF B and WRF C compared to the prior sample date. The uptick at WRF C is notable because this plant had been below the limit of detection for the two prior weeks and reached a total load that we have not observed since late February.    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral RNA levels remain low (very near the limit of detection) across the Athens-Clarke County area. Levels remained below current detection limits at WRF C (both collection days) and WRF A (Monday collection) but were detectable at WRF B. Daily case reports continue to be low across the county (7-day running average of 10 new cases per day or 8/100,000 people). As testing declines, the importance of wastewater based testing may become important to catch potential upticks in infection, but as of now, wastewater levels continue to be reduced.**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 24</span>  
Viral RNA was again below the limit of detection at WRF C but was found at both WRF A and B. The concentration at WRF A was 133,507 genome copies per liter and at WRF B was 42,707 genome copies per liter.    
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 22</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA remained below the limit of detection at WRFs A and C but increased to an average concentration of 134,180 genome copies per liter at WRF B.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 15 & 17</span>  
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **For the first time in our reporting, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels dropped below our current detection limit at all three plants, for both gene targets, on both 3/15 and 3/17.**    

<span style="text-decoration:underline">What this means</span>  
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 shedding has declined substantially across Athens Clarke County, but we cannot assume that the virus is completely absent from wastewater. Our current method of analysis has a high limit of detection, which means that SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 is very likely still present in wastewater (and in the community) but is at a concentration that our current method cannot detect. However, the drop is in line with falling case reports, which reached a 7-day running average of only 8 new cases per day by the end of the week (a level we have not observed since June 2020, before the summer peak).  

We are working on methods to increase our limit of detection as we enter a phase in the pandemic where hopefully cases continue to decline and vaccine coverage increases.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The total viral load of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater continues to remain stable. Average total loads for each week have been oscillating around 10^13 total copies, since the week beginning 2/14.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 10</span>  
Viral estimates for Wednesday 3/10 were highly variable between plants. Compared to Monday’s samples, the viral load increased considerably at WRF B. However, the viral load decreased at WRF A, and remained stable at WRF C. The variability between plants and sample dates is common, as the levels of virus drop close to or below the limit of detection for our method.   

The 7-day running average of newly-reported cases was 15.    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 8</span>  
The viral load estimated for WRF A and WRF C on Monday 3/8 was comparable to the estimates from the previous collection, on Wednesday 3/3. The total viral load at WRF B dropped 10-fold between the two collection periods. The total viral load for the county was comparable to the load observed in the previous weeks, dating back to 2/14.   

The 7-day running average of newly-reported cases was 24.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total viral load in wastewater continues to remain stable. With average loads for each week changing little since the week of 2/14. Also similar to our observations for the past three weeks, there was considerable variability between plants and between sampling dates, which may be more common as concentrations of the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 RNA approach the limit of our detection capabilities. Wastewater results suggest persistent viral shedding in the community but at levels well below their peak in January.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 3</span>   
Viral levels increased overall in samples collected on Wednesday 3/3, with SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 detected at all three plants, bringing total load in line with what we have observed since early to mid February.   

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases increased to 28 (following a single day report of 64 new cases on 3/3).      

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">March 1</span>  
Samples for Monday 3/1 were highly variable between plants. After falling below our limit of detection the prior week (Wednesday 2/24), levels at WRF A reached >300,000 copies per liter. However, levels at both WRF B and C fell below the limit of detection (for both targets) for the first time since early November.    

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases was 21.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### February 2021
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Overall, the viral load in Athens-Clarke County wastewater averaged for the week was comparable to last week's average load. However, there continues to be wide variability of viral levels in our wastewater samples. The 7-day running average of reported cases was 22 as of 02/25/2021.**     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 24</span>    
The total viral load estimated for Wednesday 2/24 declined sharply from previous observations. The positivity rate of our collection has declined; SARS-CoV-2 was only detectable in only two of our wastewater samples.  

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases in Athens was 21 per day on 2/24. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 22</span>   
Total viral load on Monday 2/22 was comparable to the viral load estimated for the previous collection, Wednesday 2/17. While there was an increase in viral load at WRF A, viral levels declined at WRF B and WRF C.   


The 7-day running average of newly reported cases in Athens dropped to 21 per day on 2/22.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **On average for the week, viral load in Athens-Clarke County wastewater declined for the fourth week in row. However, there was a wide variability between the two collection dates with very low levels on Monday offset by substantially higher loads on Wednesday. Rainfall this week likely resulted in dilution of viruses in wastewater. Newly reported cases reached a 7-day running average of 28 as of 02/19/2021.**     

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 17</span>    
Viral load for all plants increased relative to the Monday sample. No samples were below the limit of detection for either gene target and average concentrations increased relative the prior sample. It is yet not clear if this indicates a shift in trend or if this was an outlier sample.   

7-day running average of newly reported cases reached 30 on 2/17.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 15</span>    
Total viral load (all plants combined) declined sharply in the samples collected on Monday 2/15. This trend was evident at both WRF A and B with more stable levels at WRF C. Concentrations were below the limit of defection at WRF A, but this is very likely due to dilution effects.   

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases in Athens dropped to 34 per day on 2/15.    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total viral load in Athens-Clarke County wastewater declined for the third week in row, reaching levels that we have not observed since early December. These declines are similar to those observed in new reported daily cases for the county, which have declined to a 7-day running average of 37 as of Friday 2/12.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 10</span>    
Viral load for all plants combined continued to decline from the Monday sample. Again, this decline was driven largely by a lower load at a single plant (WRF A), with WRF B and C levels similar to that noted on Monday. The N1 target was below the limit of detection in the WRF A sample.   

7-day running average of newly reported cases reached 43 on 2/10.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 8</span>    
Total viral load (all plants combined) declined slightly relative to the prior sample (collected 2/3). The decline was primarily driven by lower loads at WRF C with relatively stable levels at WRFs A and B. Additionally, the N2 target was below the limit of detection at WRF C.   

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases in Athens dropped to 44 per day on 2/8.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total viral load continued to decline this week, making this the second week of decline following record high levels in mid-January. While the total viral load may be declining, shedding (and transmission) of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 remains active and it is important to maintain health and safety practices. Newly reported cases in Athens-Clarke County ended the week (2/5) at a 7-day running average of 51.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 3</span>    
Viral load for Tuesday 2/2 through Wednesday 2/3, was virtually unchanged from the Monday sample.    

7-day running average of newly reported cases was 58 on 2/3.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">February 1</span>    
Viral load (1/31 – 2/1) across the three treatment plants combined declined by ~50% compared to the prior sample last week. Declines were noted at all plants. Additionally, the N2 target was below the limit of detection at one site. This is the first week that we have not seen 100% positivity for both gene targets since early December.   

7-day running average of newly reported cases was 69 on 2/1, which declined from 82 at the end of last week.  
<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### January 2021
<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The average viral load for the week decreased from the previous week but was still higher than 70% of all samples collected to date. Note that estimates for viral load may be underestimated, due to a significant amount of rainfall during this collection period (1/27). The 7-day average of newly reported cases ended the week (1/29) at 82. Viral load and transmission remain high in Athens-Clarke County.**  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 27</span>    
Viral load for the period between Tuesday 1/26 and Wednesday 1/27 was comparable to the viral load estimated from Monday’s collection. It is important to note that Wednesday’s sampling period coincided with a major rain event in the Athens area. Infiltration of stormwater into the sewer system may dilute viral concentrations of wastewater. Sample positivity remains high (100%) and concentrations reached over 1 million copies per liter.   

The 7-day moving average for reported cases was 78 for 1/27/2021. 

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 25</span>    
The total viral load for Sunday 1/24 through Monday 1/25 decreased compared to the previous week's observations. SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 was detected from all wastewater samples (positivity rate of 100%).   

The 7-day moving average for reported cases was 74 for 1/25/2021.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Averaged for the week, total viral load continues to be high (exceeding the load in 90% of samples analyzed to date). Much like the pattern noted last week, the two samples varied substantially with the 1/19 sample reaching extremely high levels and declining the following day. This week the variability between the two days appears to be driven primarily by large changes at particular plants (especially WRF A). Overall, the average total load this week is similar to last week, changing by only 5%. Case reports in Athens-Clarke County declined this week, which follows the declines in sewage levels noted in our 1/4 report. Wastewater observations from the last two weeks suggest that shedding of the virus has increased and may not yet be apparent in case reports.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 20</span>   
Total viral load for the sample collected between 1/19 and 1/20 declined compared to the prior day sample. This is similar to the pattern noted last week as well; however, the decline was not consistent across all three plants. Viral load at WRF C (including East Athens) increased approximately 4-fold reaching a similar level noted the prior week (on 1/11). Levels at the other two plants declined or were stable.  

The 7-day running average of reported cases in Athens Clarke County further declined to 73 by 1/20.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 19</span>  
Over the 24 h period of collection (6:30 am Monday 1/18 – 6:30 am 1/19), the total viral load at all three plants combined reached the second highest level in our data set (falling only slightly behind the load for 1/11, one week ago). The load increased to the highest level recorded at WRF A (including north Athens, downtown, and UGA), where average concentration exceeded 10 million copies per liter. Little change was observed at WRF B and WRF C compared to levels on 1/13.   

The 7-day running average of reported cases in Athens Clarke County declined to 81 on 1/19.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **The average viral load for the week was among the highest in our sample collection (exceeding the viral load for >94% of samples to date). This was driven by very high counts in Monday’s (1/11) sample. The 7-day average of newly reported cases ended the week (1/15) at 105. Viral load and transmission remain high in Athens-Clarke County.**

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 13</span>     
 Viral load for the period between Tuesday 1/12 and Wednesday 1/13 declined from the all-time high noted in Monday’s sample. The decline in load was noted in all treatment plants but sample positivity remains high (100%) and concentrations reached over 3 million copies per liter.   
 
The 7-day moving average for reported cases was 108 for 1/13/2021.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 11</span>   
Total viral load for Sunday 1/10 through Monday 1/11 increased by 5-fold compared to levels measured the week prior, reaching the highest recorded total viral load through the course of this study. Concentrations increased at all three plants, exceeding 4 million copies per liter. The rate of increase and total load are similar to the trends noted in early to mid-August around the start of the UGA fall semester. These results may reflect an acceleration of new infections,  the increase in population (and possible carriers) with the arrival of students for the start of the UGA spring term, or both.   

The reported 7-day moving average of clinical cases in Athens-Clarke County increased to 107 on 1/11.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update:**</span> **Total SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viral load decreased slightly for the second week in row, while case reports continue to climb. Levels in wastewater are a real time estimate of viral shedding, and therefore may be out of sync with the timing of case reports, which often lag because of bias toward symptomatic infections and the time between testing and reporting. This current trend could suggest stabilizing case levels, which may not yet be apparent in the clinical reports.  However, our total positivity rate for samples remains at 100%, which indicates that viral shedding (and likely transmission) remain high.**  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">January 4</span>   
Total viral load for Sunday 1/3 through Monday 1/4 decreased slightly compared to levels measured the week prior, although detection rate remains high (all samples from all plants for both the N1 and N2 gene have been positive since 12/14/2020).  

Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County increased from a 7-day running average of 46 on 12/28/2020 to 84 on 1/4/2021. Although total viral load is currently steady or declining, the current rise in reported cases that began on 12/28 was preceded by 3 weeks of increasing viral load in wastewater (which peaked on 12/21/2020). 

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Note from the team:</span>   
We apologize for the delay in data updates over the last couple of weeks. Critical supplies for our analyses were back ordered and then delayed in shipping. We are now back up and running and working to process our backlog. We will aim to get back to timely updates by next week. One benefit of this short break was that we were able to take some much-needed time to look back critically at our last 30 weeks of work, which has been difficult to do while also in the crunch to get samples processed and analyzed. We reanalyzed the full data set and conducted an intense QA/QC. You will see some slight changes in the charts on the dashboard that reflect this new analysis. We thank you for sticking with us through what has become a much longer effort than any of us imagined.

##### December 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 28</span>   
Total viral load for Sunday 12/27 through Monday 12/28 declined by ~10-fold. This decline was observed across all three treatment plants and ends the 3-week trend of rising viral load at WRF C.  

The 7-day running average of reported cases was 54 as of 12/30, which has held steady for the past 10 days (declining from 61 on 12/21).  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 21</span>     
Total viral load was comparable to observations from the previous week. Viral load continues to increase at WRF C, continuing a 2+ week trend. These data suggest that there is consistent viral shedding, but stable transmission within the community.   

As of 12/21 there was an average of 61 new daily cases (7-day running average).  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update 12/14-12/16:**</span> **The total viral load detected from wastewater for the week of 12/14/2020 continued to increase compared to previous observations; 12/16/2020 marks the highest level observed since August.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 16</span>     
Total viral load for Tuesday 12/15 through Wednesday 12/16 increased to the highest observed level since early August. Total load increased at all three plants, and was especially notable at WRF C, which reached its highest load and concentration to date. This suggests a continued rise in reported cases is likely in the coming days.  

The 7-day running average of reported cases as of 12/16 was 62.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 14</span>  
Total viral load for Sunday 12/13 through Monday 12/14 was consistent with those observed last week, suggesting consistent but stable transmission within the community.  

As of 12/14 there was an average of 58 new daily cases (7-day running average). Athens-Clarke county has reported an average of 54 - 58 new cases per day since 12/5.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update 12/7-12/9:**</span> **Total viral loads for the week of 12/07/2020 have increased compared to the prior week; coupled with clinical data, increased viral levels indicate active transmission in the community.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 9</span>   
Total viral load for Tuesday 12/8 through Wednesday 12/9 remains consistent with the increasing trend observed on 12/7. Coupled with an increase in newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases, increasing levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater suggest an increase in viral transmission within the community.    

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 7</span>   
The total viral load has increased compared to estimates from the previous week. This increase corresponds with the overall increasing trend in viral load over the past several weeks. Coupled with an increase in newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases (seven day running average of 56), these data suggest an increase in viral transmission within the community.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">**Key Weekly Update 11/30-12/2:**</span> **Total viral loads for the week of 11/30/2020 declined compared to the prior week; however, levels continue to indicate active transmission in the community.**   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Site update announcement</span>   
Starting this week (Nov 30 & Dec 2 sampling) we will be reporting our SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 wastewater viral load data as a single metric to improve comprehension. Viral load data will be reported as the average of the N1 and N2 gene targets detected using our assay. Concentration values for both targets will still be reported independently in the "All Data" tab. We feel that this is an easier to understand presentation of the data and is supported after considering 30 weeks of data collection.  

<span style="text-decoration:underline">December 2</span>   
Concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 viruses were similar between the 12/2 sample and that collected on 11/30. However, overall viral load declined slightly across the area, with the exception of WRF C, where viral load has been steady to increasing.  

As of 12/03/2020, the 7-day running average of new cases in Athens Clarke County reached 39, which is higher than we have observed since September. As we have noted before, viral levels in wastewater general precede case reports in the community. The uptick in cases this week follows elevated viral loads in sewage that we noted last week.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### November 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 30</span>    
Total viral load for Sunday 11/29 through Monday 11/30 was similar to that noted last week. Of note, this sample collection period included periods of heavy rain on Sunday, which resulted in infiltration of rainwater into sewer lines. This leads to higher than normal volumes entering the treatment plants and diluting of the sewage. Not surprisingly, we noted a decline in the concentration (number of viral copies per liter) because of this dilution (see ‘All Data’), but our estimation of total viral load (total viral copies present) accounts for this effect by correcting for the higher volume. Therefore, total viral load remains high despite the lower concentration.  

As of Monday 11/30, the 7-day average of new cases in Athens Clarke County remained at 30. However, on Wednesday 12/2 the county reported 78 new cases, which is the largest single day report since 9/16 (80 cases).  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 25</span>   
The increasing trend observed on 11/23 continued through 11/25 suggesting an increase in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 transmission compared to the prior weeks of sampling. This increase was not observed in the reported clinical cases which have remained steady at approximately 29 cases per day for the past two weeks.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 23</span>   
The levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 have increased approximately 10-fold from the previous sampling period (November 18, 2020). It is too to soon to predict if the increase in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 levels indicates in increase in transmission. If there is increased transmission, we would expect to see this same trend in our next sampling period (November 25, 2020).  

The 7-day running average of newly reported cases has remained stable for the last 2 weeks (ranging between 27 and 32 new cases per day).  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 18</span>  
There was little change in the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations and total load for the sample collected on 11/18. Levels were comparable to those measured on 11/16 and in the previous week. Good agreement was observed in the estimation of both the N1 and N2 gene targets.  

Daily reported cases remain at a seven-day average of 32.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 16</span>  
For the Monday sample this week (collected between 6:30 am Sunday 11/15 and 6:30 am Monday 11/16). We observed increased concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 at all plants based on the N1 gene; concentrations (copies per L) increased by >80% since the November 11 sample. However, the N2 gene target was below the limit of detection for all plants. We observed a similar divergence on 11/04 and we are continuing to evaluate the performance of both assays. On balance, the data suggest a slight but consistent increasing trend.  

The 7-day running average of daily reported cases in Athens-Clarke County is 31 as of 11/17, similar to that reported last week, after several weeks of reported cases in the low 20s.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 9 & 11</span>  
This week, 24-hour composite samples were collected on Monday 11/9 and Wednesday 11/11. Total daily load estimates for the week show stable to increasing levels. WRF A loads increased modestly on 11/9 with little change by 11/11. At WRF B, estimated loads declined to the limit of detection on 11/9 but increased to >500,000 copies per liter for both gene targets by 11/11. WRF C loads increased through both sampling dates. Of note, both gene targets were detected this week, with notable increases in the N2 gene (which was largely below the limit of detection last week).  

The 7-day running average of daily reported cases (PCR confirmed) in Athens-Clarke County has increased slightly in the last week to an average of 31 cases per day as of 11/12.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Site update announcement:</span>    
Beginning November 2, 2020, data from all three plants is being reported on this site. Data summaries have been updated to include the third plant (WRF C) back to July 5, 2020. Therefore, charts for ‘data trends’ and ‘all data’ may vary slightly from previously posted reports because of this inclusion; although, in part because WRF C is small compared to the other two plants, trends changed little with this update.  

Going forward, we will begin sampling twice weekly at the three WRFs with support from Athens-Clarke County. We will update this site with any anticipated changes in timing of our data reporting.   

<span style="text-decoration:underline">November 2 & 4 data update:</span>
This week, we are reporting concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in wastewater collected from two sampling events (~6:30 am Sunday Nov 1 to ~ 6:30 am Monday Nov. 2 and ~6:30 am Tuesday Nov. 3 to ~6:30 am Wednesday Nov. 4, 2020). The increased sampling frequency is intended to improve the resolution of our data.    
This week, there was a notable difference in the trends based on the two gene targets, with viral gene copies attributed to the N1 gene increasing slightly (especially at WRF B) or staying steady and viral gene copies attributed to the N2 gene declining (with most samples at or below the limit of our detection). Detection rates of the two genes can vary, especially in wastewater; therefore, it is important to consider results of these targets together. In combination, we think that these results suggest SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 loads are stable or may be declining   

The 7-day running average of reported cases (PCR confirmed) in Athens-Clarke County has remained steady at 22 - 24 new cases per day.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### October 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 27</span>    
Concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in Athens-Clarke County wastewater are comparable to those reported during the previous week (October 20, 2020). Concentrations are also similar between the two plants. These data suggest that there may be persistent viral shedding throughout the community. Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County have been stable over the past three weeks, with a 7-day running averages of 20-24 cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 20</span>    
SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations in Athens-Clarke County wastewater showed a consistent upward trend this week. WRF A continued its increase from the prior week with concentrations reaching as high as 1 million copies per L. Concentrations at WRF B increased from the below the limit of detection to >300,000 copies per L. The continued upward trends may suggest changes in viral shedding within the community.  

Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County have been stable over the week, with a 7-day running average of 20-30 cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 13</span>    
Trends in SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations in Athens wastewater were split this week between the two sampled plants. During the collection period (Oct 12 – 13), viral RNA concentrations at WRF B declined to at or below the limit of detection. However, levels at WRF A increased to >500,000 copies per L, after declining to near the limit of detection the prior week. It is too early to know if the increased SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 signal at WRF A is indicative of possible uptick in transmission or due to inherent variability in sample collection. If there is increased transmission, we would expect to see the trend in wastewater continue next week as well as an increase in reported cases.  

Reported cases in Athens-Clarke County have remained stable for the last 2 weeks (7-day running average between 21 and 24 new cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">October 6</span>    
Levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 continue to decrease in wastewater samples collected from Athens-Clarke County. These results are consistent with the decrease in the number of newly-reported cases over the past two weeks.   

It is important to note that the levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus have decreased to or at the limit of detection for our current method. Our theoretical limit of detection is approximately 3,570 copies/L. Below this concentration, viruses may be not be detected or quantified with accuracy.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### September 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 29</span>    
Overall SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations continued to decline in sewage reaching Athens's WRFs, in line with decreasing reported cases in Athens-Clarke County. The decline was especially evident at WRF A, where levels were at or below the limit of detection for our methods. However, concentrations at WRF B were virtually unchanged from last week.  

With our current process, we cannot accurately detect virus concentrations below about 3,000 copies per L. Therefore, we cannot assume that a sample that is 'below the limit of detection' is negative for SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2, rather it may be at some level that we cannot accurately determine with our current method. Our lab is evaluating different detection options that may improve detection during times with lower levels of circulating virus.   

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 22</span>    
Concentrations of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 declined this week in wastewater collected from both WRFs. Average levels remain above 100,000 copies/L. This decline is consistent with declines in reported cases in Athens-Clarke County.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 15</span>    
This week, the level SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 continued to exceed 1 million copies of virus per liter of sewage. While the 7-day running average of new cases has declined in Athens-Clarke County, there were no significant changes in the level of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus in wastewater, compared to those observed on September 9, 2020.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 8</span>    
This week, levels of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 for both targets at both plants continued to exceed 1 million copies of virus per liter of sewage. Average values were similar to concentrations from the prior week (September 1, 2020) with virtually no change in the average levels at WRF B and a 6% reduction at WRF A.  

An important note about sample collection this week was that it occurred over the Labor Day holiday and may explain the slight reduction in viral concentration at the WRF A plant. Samples were collected between ~6:30 am Monday through 6:30 am Tuesday. The volume of wastewater flowing into WRF A decreased from 5.73 million gallons on September 1, 2020 to 4.96 million gallons on September 8, 2020. The collection area for WRF A includes the UGA main campus and Downtown Athens. We suspect that this week's data point reflects the real-time effect of population movement on viral levels in wastewater. In other words, a closed campus and likely large number of people traveling reduces the input. Samples collected on a particular day reflect the inputs of that day and not necessarily the entire week.  

Our trend analysis suggests a continued elevation in total viral load (see data trends tab).  

Daily reported cases in Athens-Clarke County continue to rise, now reaching a 7-day moving average of 126.1 new cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Sept 1</span>    
This week continues the trend of the past month with SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations increasing in wastewater. Levels increased to their highest point since the beginning of data collection with average concentrations for both plants and both targets exceeding 3 million copies of virus per liter of sewage, approximately 10-fold higher than the prior week. Daily reported cases in Clarke County also continued to rise reaching a 7-day moving average of >74 cases per day.

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

##### August 2020

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Aug 25</span>    
SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in Athens-Clarke County wastewater increased slightly in this week's samples (reaching >900,000 copies of the virus per liter of sewage). This moderate increase continues the upward trend observed over the prior three weeks. Reported cases have remained steady through the week (8/18 - 8/25/2020) averaging ~30 new cases per day.  

<div style="margin-bottom:25px;">
</div>

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Aug 28</span>    
On August 18, 2020, the concentration of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 increased to over 100,000 copies per liter for both gene targets. This uptick is somewhat reflected in the daily reported cases for Athens-Clarke county and may indicate further increases in the coming weeks.  

Furthermore, this week marks the return of approximately 30,000 undergraduate students to the UGA main campus for the start of the fall semester.

<span style="text-decoration:underline">Prior to Aug 18, 2020</span>    
Weekly analyses of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in sewage began June 16, 2020, at which time concentrations were below the current method limit of detection and new cases were reported at <10 per day. Reported cases began to increase to >20 per day in late June and SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentration  increased to up to 10 million viral copies per liter. Sewage concentrations were steady through mid-July inline with newly reported cases averaging 35 per day. Beginning July 21, 2020 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentrations in sewage began to decline through early August, while concurrent case report remained high. We suspect that this decline possibly preceded the decline in cases noted in late August, which may be due to lags in testing results and case reporting.  

Since August 4, 2020 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 concentration has steadily increased for both the N1 and N2 gene targets. This suggests that sewage concentrations may be a leading indicator for new cases in the community, but more data collection and  monitoring of delays in testing reports will be needed to confirm this trend.

### Individual Plants {.tabset}

Three plants service the Athens-Clarke County region. WRF A serves the largest portion of the community (including all of UGA main campus and downtown Athens), followed by WRF B (including areas west of Milledge Ave.), and WRF C (including Athens Eastside). Total capacity at WRF C is substantially smaller than the other two plants; this plant also receives periodic waste from pumped septic system and ‘port-o-potties’, which may lead to increased variability over time. Load and trends over time are shown for each service area. Trend analyses follow the same procedure as noted in ‘Data Trends’ tab.

This chart provides the concentration for SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 at each of three plants in Athens-Clarke County for each sampling period. Symbols represent the mean concentration for the two viral gene targets at each of the three plants. Therefore, each sampling date includes six data points (2 gene targets x 3 plants).   

Samples are collected once weekly as a 24-hour composite sample at each plant. We measure the virus by detecting two genes specific to SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2, the N1 and N2 nucleocapsid genes, using RT-qPCR. The N1 and N2 gene targets are measured and reported as a concentration, in number of gene copies per liter of wastewater for each plant. The theoretical Limit of Detection (LOD) is noted with a dashed line.    

The daily number of newly reported COVID&#8209;19 cases in Athens-Clarke County (purple bars) appear alongside the 7-day moving average of new cases (yellow line).

### Research Overview 

#### Purpose

Wastewater-based surveillance is an emerging tool for monitoring disease outbreaks. Coupled with clinical surveillance, wastewater surveillance can be used to help understand trends in viruses circulating within local population.  

To better understand the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID&#8209;19) on a local level, we are monitoring wastewater samples from water reclamation facilities in Athens, GA. Wastewater samples are collected weekly and tested to detect the disease-causing virus, SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2.  

Each sample is a composite of the wastewater received by the water reclamation facility in a single 24-hour period. By examining these samples, we are capturing a snapshot into the health of the entire community that contributes to the sewershed. This wastewater-based research provides a new approach to epidemiology; sewage surveillance may be used to help understand potential burden of disease at a community-scale and trends in viral prevalence (indicating shifts in transmission), without extensive clinical sampling. These data should be considered complementary to on-going clinical testing.  

We are sharing here some of the preliminary results of our wastewater monitoring program. Our objective is to critically examine the use of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 wastewater-based epidemiology for the detection and surveillance of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 in our local community.  

We are developing and evaluating our methods in real-time. We will share with you our weekly results and newest developments. This data is intended to complement clinical-based COVID&#8209;19 surveillance data, that will together, inform public health decisions.

#### Methods

Since May 2020, sewage samples have been collected weekly from the three water reclamation facilities (WRFs) that serve Athens-Clarke County. Samples are collected from a 24-hour composite of the influent wastewater received by each WRF.  

Samples are processed by the Lipp Laboratory at the University of Georgia (Department of Environmental Health Science) to detect and measure the abundance of SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus in wastewater.

Viral RNA, the genetic material of the SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 virus, is extracted from each sample using the <a href="https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/diagnostics-and-clinical-research/sample-processing/qiaamp-viral-rna-mini-kit/#orderinginformation" target="_blank">QIAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit.</a>

The viral RNA is then measured using Real-Time RT-PCR Assays, following the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sars/guidance/f-lab/assays.html" target="_blank">CDC's test protocol </a> for the N1 and N2 SARS&#8209;CoV&#8209;2 nucleocapsid genes. Note, on 7/19/2021 we moved our analyses to a new qPCR machine which has resulted in improved sample precision from this date onward.

The N1 and N2 gene targets are measured and reported as a concentration per liter of wastewater (shown in ‘All Data’). N1 and N2 concentrations are then averaged and multiplied by the incoming flow at each plant to determine a total viral load per sampling day.  

Reported case data for COVID-19 has been collected from <a href="https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report" target="_blank">Georgia's Department of Public Health</a> and summarized by Mark Ebell, MD, MS <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vS701zSLS_VgpMUVSuGWI89Y05Yev3QCCF-l0nbwtSN1tE-hGlMV1T2Tg0GFVuiVD010szZ1ukr7vnM/pubhtml" target="_blank">here</a>.
